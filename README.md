use these at your own risk/ I take no responsibility for administrative punishment at school or work,

with all that

1. HOLYUNBLOCKER: https://holyunblocker.church/choice
    Uses 3 different proxy services, the best in my oppinion is WOMGINX (https://github.com/binary-person/womginx)
2. YOUTUBE API: https://ytapi.com/ 
3.    Not technically a "proxy" but it is unblocked and has no ads
4. ULTRAVIOLET: https://ultravioletsw.dev/ 
5.    Can be a bit spotty but when it works it runs fast, only works with a handfull of websites (discord, youtube, ect)
6. EAGLERCRAFT: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LAX1DUDE/eaglercraft/main/stable-download/Offline_Download_Version.html" 
7.    Eaglercraft is minecraft 1.5.2 that runs in your browser, it also has server support.
