JOHGHNS PROXY COLLECTION

use these at your own risk/ I take no responsibility for administrative punishment at school or work,

with all that

1. HOLYUNBLOCKER: https://holyunblocker.church/choice  
    Uses 3 different proxy services, the best in my oppinion is WOMGINX (https://github.com/binary-person/womginx) 
2. YOUTUBE API: https://ytapi.com/
    Not technically a "proxy" but it is unblocked and has no ads
3. ULTRAVIOLET: https://ultravioletsw.dev/
    Can be a bit spotty but when it works it runs fast, only works with a handfull of websites (discord, youtube, ect)
